        decript:'EUROPE-AUTOS SALES/ (PIX):European car sales drop in January as falling combustion engines outweigh EV gains',
        content:'Feb 25 (Reuters) - New car sales in Europe were down by 2.1% in January, as a jump in fully electric and hybrid-electric car registrations in its main markets was not enough to compensate for falling petrol and diesel sales, industry data showed on Tuesday.Overall sales in France, Italy, Germany and Britain were down from last year, with only Spain recording a year-on-year increase among top selling nations, data by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed.WHY ITS IMPORTANTThe EU executive will present auto sector plans on March 5, following talks with automakers, unions and interest groups.EU carmakers, which are struggling to compete with Chinese rivals and bracing for U.S. tariffs, are urging the Commission to grant relief from potential fines resulting from CO2 car emission targets that came into effect in January.Some automakers have increased the prices of petrol engine models to encourage EV adoption, but the industry fears that customers will simply buy fewer cars.Electric transport groups, instead, claim that any push to weaken the targets will disrupt investments in EV infrastructure and hamper the bloc competitiveness.BY THE NUMBERS January sales in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) fell slightly below 1 million cars sold, the lowest volume since August.Registrations at Volkswagen and Renault grew by 5.3% and 5.4% respectively, while they fell by 16% at Stellantis.In the EU, January sales fell by 2.6%, even as the registrations of battery electric (BEV) and hybrid electric (HEV) cars grew by 34% and 18.4% respectively. Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) sales were instead down by 8.5%.',
        content2:'Electrified vehicles - either BEV, HEV or PHEV - sold in the bloc accounted for 57.2% of passenger car registrations in January, up from 47.4% in the previous year.Among the largest EU markets, Spain sales increased by 5.3%, while in France, Italy and Germany they dropped by 6.2%, 5.8% and 2.8%. In Britain they were down 2.5%.While battling to bring down high costs in home markets and fighting competition from China, European carmakers are also preparing to face potential import tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump has raised tariffs on aluminium and steel and threatened a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as on all autos and semiconductors.

        decript:'While components in most desktop computers can be easily — well, relatively easily — replaced, laptops tend to be far more difficult to upgrade or replace. Intel is pushing a modular concept that could make upgrading your laptop less expensive than buying a new one and substantially reduce e-waste.....',
        content:'A few years ago, Dell introduced Concept Luna, a laptop design featuring modular components that could be upgraded through a robotic upgrade station at a retailer. Similar to a vending machine, the system allowed a robot to handle the upgrade process.Let’s talk about modular computers that started with the IBM PCjr, moved to an IBM modular computer concept (I was approached to be CEO for one of the potential spin-off companies), the Dell effort, and finally, the Intel concept this week.We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a brand-new laptop that could be ideal for an executive or someone interested in a lot of performance in a small, quiet form factor.',
        content2:'The IBM PCjr was a revolutionary desktop design based on the ability to update the product easily. Updated components were packaged kind of like game cartridges in that you buy the basic system and then upgrade it by purchasing and adding components that were covered in plastic and could be plugged into the base unit.It was an amazing design until the folks doing the more expensive IBM PC figured out it was so much better and cheaper that folks would likely prefer it over IBM’s more expensive, non-modular products. So, they crippled the PCjr by removing a lot of what would have made it attractive for business (the PCjr was positioned as a consumer PC). While making it unattractive for business, they also made it unappealing for the rest of us, so the product failed.Now, compare that approach to what Steve Jobs did with the iPod. He realized customers would likely prefer a phone with the iPod’s functionality. Instead of crippling the iPhone to protect the iPod, he leaned into the trend and ended up nearly owning the entire smartphone segment. That strategic move is largely why Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world.If IBM had done the same with the PCjr, it would have protected its leadership position in PCs and might have been in that business today.The next modular effort was the Archistrat 4s server from a company staffed with ex-IBM people called the Panda Project. It used a passive backplane, allowing components to be easily plugged in or removed to add accessories. The entire system was housed in a vault-like case — made of heavy metal, lockable for security, and designed to be bolted to the floor — so offices without server rooms could keep it in open areas without worrying about theft.That company failed because the executives had inferior financial skills and wasted a lot of money on parties, jets, and other things not related to the business.The next attempt was the IBM MetaPad, a modular computer with a core computing unit about the size of a cigarette pack, containing everything except a battery, keyboard, or display. It could be placed in a laptop case or docked on a desktop.A company called Antelope Technologies pursued a similar concept, aiming to create a market for it. However, due to its unique design and low initial production volume, it was relatively expensive, as were the docks that could have been integrated into cars, hospitals, hotel rooms, or even airplane seats, providing full PC functionality and an easy upgrade path for the core technology.The problem was that the core module wasn’t very powerful due to thermal and cost constraints, and docks for it never became widely available in the places they were envisioned. As a result, it never reached the necessary volume to drive down costs. Performance was also an issue — mobile PC technology at the time wasn’t efficient enough to make the concept viable in a laptop form. By then, IBM had begun shifting away from the PC market and was unwilling to throw money at a project like this. So, it died.More recently, Dell developed a green project, Concept Luna, that used a robotic upgrade machine that could be placed at locations like Best Buy so users could quickly and cheaply upgrade, modify, or personalize their laptop. This was one of the most well-thought-out concepts I’ve ever seen. The benefits started with a massive potential for reduced e-waste, lower lifetime PC ownership costs, and potentially more loyal customers. Sadly, Dell decided not to bring it to market.'

        content:'This AI-feeding frenzy reminds me more and more of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, but with less focus on overpaying employees. As it was then, the core issue now is companies screaming that their AI is better, but most buyers are still not well enough informed or trained to deploy AI effectively.One of the big problems DeepSeek seemed to address out of the box is that quality is important in an AI. What makes DeepSeek interesting is that rather than glossing over that problem, it addressed it up front, resulting in what appears to be both a cheaper and better AI alternative.It is also fascinating that because DeepSeek was blocked from using Nvidia’s current top AI technologies, its developers optimized the model to work better on older Nvidia technology. The result appears to be 94% cost savings in creating the model.These cost savings have improved performance while reducing expenses. The trade-off is the typical security concern and potential model corruption by the Chinese government, although China may simply be using a filter that blocks unacceptable queries and doesn’t corrupt the core AI.Let’s discuss AI-wars this week, with a focus on DeepSeek. We’ll close with my Product of the Week from Samsung, which is arguably the most premium non-foldable phone on the market and a showcase of Qualcomm’s latest processor    DeepSeek: It’s Good. But…Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard of DeepSeek. Its entry into the market tanked Nvidia stock last week (even though many argue it shouldn’t have done that) and put OpenAI on notice that there is a new AI sheriff in town from China.I’ve been arguing for some time that the industry’s huge mistake was focusing more on speed than quality and accuracy because AIs have become increasingly unreliable over time. What DeepSeek did differently was build in an AI quality check. Instead of just focusing on speed, it puts a lot of effort into quality. The result is impressive.The other advantage to DeepSeek is that while it takes around $100 million to spin up a generative AI model like DeepSeek’s, it claims it did it for only $6 million, resulting in a better, cheaper product. Better and cheaper generally result in a win.OpenAI is not amused and is suing DeepSeek. However, the lack of cooperation between the U.S. and China makes it unlikely that OpenAI will prevail globally in this effort because China will certainly not support it, which is where DeepSeek is based.',
        content2:'DeepSeek’s origin in China presents a significant drawback because the Chinese government appears to be interfering with the app. Users are blocked from asking questions about anything China finds sensitive or critical of the government’s actions, past or present.While this looks to be a front-end filter, typically, when you place artificial rules on an AI, it will both seek to break them and foster a knowledge base on how to get around the restrictions, which could eventually result in a degradation of accuracy that defines this product.Finally, if the U.S. government has issues with TikTok, it will hate DeepSeek because it is more damaging and appears closer to the Chinese government than TikTok. This AI brings up huge domestic privacy and security concerns that easily eclipse those surrounding TikTok, given how an AI is trained and how much more information could be captured from its users.AI Wars->The competition is just beginning, as we are already up to our necks in new AI companies at 1,532. Most of these companies will be acquired or will fail, which makes this a really interesting and impressively scary market to work or invest in at the moment, much like it was back in those dot-com days when VCs were throwing money at internet companies until it became clear that many of them weren’t going to make it to revenue, let alone profit.This rapid evolution in AI is only a precursor to what we are likely to see in a few years when the first AGI (artificial general intelligence) products show up. Things will likely get crazy because most of the limitations with generative AI will go away, models should drop rapidly in price, and much like the internet is everywhere now, AI will be on the fast path to being everywhere then.The amount of money in play is in the trillions of dollars for whoever gets this right first. If Elon Musk is displaced at the top of the rich guy pile, it will likely be by someone as closely connected to AGI as Musk was to electric cars a decade ago. Since AI covers robotics and self-driving vehicles, whoever that is may eclipse Musk quickly once their AGI product sells at scale.There is already both a fight for top talent and significant efforts to get AI to develop itself. The latter effort is likely to be the most disruptive because once AI can develop itself, the door opens to an even bigger problem with speed and quality unless that quality aspect is addressed as DeepSeek has.Nvidia Is in Trouble.-> ButSince the DeepSeek announcement, people have argued that Nvidia is in trouble, so its valuation has taken a beating. However, Nvidia isn’t in trouble because of DeepSeek. It is in trouble because of the U.S. policy preventing Nvidia from selling its best tech to China. As a result, China is figuring out how to use older technology effectively, which has enabled DeepSeek’s impressive, inexpensive, and accurate performance.Instead of protecting Nvidia and other U.S. companies, this policy is turning China into a far stronger competitor and effectively locking Nvidia out of competing with Chinese companies. The embargo doesn’t prevent China from getting and reverse engineering a part; they have been doing that for decades with defense technology, and a commercially available part is pretty easy to gray market. So, the embargo only creates the illusion of security and limits Nvidia from protecting its IP more effectively.'

    content:'Former India cricketer Suresh Raina said that India’s promotion of Rohit Sharma as an opener was the masterstroke which helped them win the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. India won the tournament under the leadership of MS Dhoni as they beat hosts England in the final. A team full of young stars shone in the 50-over event after the selectors didn’t pick senior players such as Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Harbhajan Singh in the team.Recently, Raina recalled India’s historic win and stated the crucial role played by Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma in giving flying starts to the team. Rohit was promoted as the opener in the opening match after successfuly acing his audition with a match-winning 83 in the previous series against England. Rohit and Dhawan instantly clicked as they added 127 runs for the first wicket in the opening game against South Africa.Raina mentioned how the duo complemented each other and approached their innings with meticulous planning.',
    content2:'That was a masterstroke. Just look at the way they batted—they focused on timing rather than forcing shots. They attacked when the delivery deserved it. Rohit, technically very sound, wore the ball down before accelerating, while Shikhar stepped out and took on the bowlers. Left-right combinations always trouble bowlers, and Shikhar was an aggressive striker in his own way. Rohit could hit a six whenever he wanted," Raina said on The Suresh Raina Experience: Champions Trophy Special.Rohit and Dhawan added another century opening stand in the second game against West Indies, followed by 58 and 77-run stands against Pakistan and Sri Lanka respectively."Their partnerships were effortless. A 100-run stand quickly turned into 150. They trusted each other’s calls and had great understanding, which made a huge difference," Raina added.Rohit-Dhawan became fourth most successful opening pair Courtesy of their good starts, India managed to register commanding victories in the first four matches as they romped over their opponents on their way to the final. After India beat England by five runs to clinch their second Champions Trophy title, Dhawan was adjudged Player of the Tournament for finishing as the highest run scorer with 363 runs from five matches. On the other hand, Rohit was the fourth-highest run getter with 177 runs from five innings.After guiding India to Champions Trophy glory, Rohit and Dhawan went on to etch their name in the record books as the fourth most successful opening partners in ODI history. They scored 5148 runs together from 115 innings at an average of 45.55 with 18 century stands and 15 half century partnerships.'

    content:'Royal Challengers Bengaluru are proving pre-tournament predictions wrong. Despite missing some of their key stars due to injury concerns, the Smriti Mandhana-led side have made a strong start to their title defence, showing the world they are more than capable of winning the Womens Premier League againDays after successfully chasing 202 against Gujarat Giants in the season opener in Vadodara, RCB delivered a clinical all-round performance against Delhi Capitals in their Womens Premier League match at the Kotambi Stadium on February 17. Led by Smriti Mandhanas fluent 47-ball 81, RCB chased down a below-par total of 142 to climb to the top of the WPL points table early in the season.Mandhana was dismissed for 81 in the 16th over when she attempted a cheeky scoop shot to find another boundary off Shikha Pandey. While Delhi managed to halt the carnage, it was too late, as RCB required just 8 more runs when their captain walked back to the pavilionSuperstar Ellyse Perry and Richa Ghosh ensured RCB got past the finish line with eight wickets and 22 balls to spare. Richa, who smashed a 27-ball 64 in their chase against Gujarat, finished the chase against Delhi in style, hitting a huge six in the second ball of the 17th over.RCB made their intentions clear in the powerplay, racing to 57 runs. Smriti received solid support from Danielle Wyatt, who struck 42 off 33 balls. The two openers stitched together their first hundred-run partnership of the WPL, adding 107 runs in just 65 balls. It was a modern-day T20 masterclass, with both batters relentlessly attacking the Delhi bowlers, giving Meg Lannings side no respite.',
    content2:'The emphatic win, which will significantly boost RCBs Net Run Rate, was set up by their bowlers, led by fast bowler Renuka Singh Thakur. RCB had conceded over 200 runs in their season opener, but the return of senior spinner Ekta Bisht made their bowling attack look far more balanced. Renuka and Georgia Wareham took three wickets each, while Ekta and Kim Garth claimed two apiece to restrict Delhi’s formidable batting line-up to just 141.The late evening dew at Kotambi Stadium made it nearly impossible for Delhi to defend a modest total as Smriti and Wyatt took their bowlers apart.The trend of chasing teams dominating matches in the Vadodara leg of the WPL continued. RCB won half the battle at the toss when Smriti opted to bowl first, and she would have been delighted to see her bowlers step up and exploit the advantage, denying Delhi those extra few runs that could have given their bowlers some much-needed breathing room.Ekta Bisht and Georgia Wareham made life difficult for the Delhi Capitals batters. Ekta, 39, proved her mettle as she must have been under a bit of pressure, replacing leg-spinner Prema Rawat, who did well against the Giants.Nothing went Delhi Capitals way as their changes did not work. Delhi brought in Marizanne Kapp and Jess Jonassen after dropping Player of the Match from the opener, Nikki Prasad, and Alice Capsey. However, both Kapp and Jonassen failed to step up and deliver for the Capitals.RCB will look to make it a hat-trick of wins when they take on Mumbai Indians at home on February 21. RCB will enjoy the home support at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in the next leg of the WPL. '
